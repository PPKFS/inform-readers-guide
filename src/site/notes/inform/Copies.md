- build makes a project graph and calls on [[inform/Incremental Building|Incremental Building]]
	- But I can't find much more about what the graph consists of, it seems to magically claim that [[Inbuild|Inbuild]] can just...make the project.
- A "copy" of a work exists in the file system when we've actually got hold of some edition of it. For some genres, copies will be files; for others,
  directories holding a set of files.
- A purist view would be that a copy is simply an edition at a location in the file system. And so it is. But copies are the main things Inbuild works on, and we will need to generate data about them, some of which is most usefully stored here.
