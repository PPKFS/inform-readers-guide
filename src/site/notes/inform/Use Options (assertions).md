Ooh, I see - so here we check for anything like “Use \<blah\>” which means that we need to check for a proper noun phrase. That’s why we had to make a proper noun in [[inform/New Use Option Requests|New Use Option Requests]] → [[inform/Nouns|Nouns]].
In addition it also has the hooks for some specific use options (and not just the custom ones):
- `use-inter-pipeline` with [[inform/Inbuild Control|Inbuild Control]]
- `use-index-language` with [[inform/Language Services|Language Services]] and [[inform/Project Services|Project Services]]
- `use-memory-setting` with [[inform/Use Options (runtime)|Use Options (runtime)]]

`ALLOW_IN_OPTIONS_FILE_SMFT` for [[inform/Special Meanings|Special Meanings]] - [[inform/The Options File|The Options File]]
