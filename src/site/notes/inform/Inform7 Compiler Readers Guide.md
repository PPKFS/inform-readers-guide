# Inform7 Compiler Reader’s Guide

## What is this?
The [Inform7 compiler documentation](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/index.html) is excellent, but it is very easy to lose the forest for the trees. For instance, it’s easy enough to find the sentence breaking code but have fun working out the flow from the command line to the callsite!

The aim of this site is to provide a complement to the full documentation. By zooming out, we can look at the forest and ignore the trees entirely. This should make it easier to, therefore, understand whatever component(s) of the Inform 7 compiler that are of interest (for example, relations) without having to worry about which of the services and modules you need to read first.

For the most part the structure here will just mirror that of the docs themselves, but the first few links will be independent flows and collections of relevant links for specific perspectives. My point of interest, for example, is the compiler as a whole -- so I’m writing the [[inform/Compilation Flow|Compilation Flow]] page to allow me to ignore the `inbuild` process or extension census manager.
