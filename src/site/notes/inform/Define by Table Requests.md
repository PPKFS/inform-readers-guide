# Contents
All the variants of “Some X are defined by Table Y”.
- We enumerate the table in pass 0, over in [[inform/Tables (assertions)|Tables (assertions)]] I think.
- In pass 1, as we now have the table, we can start looking at the elements of it.
	- We get the first column, make some stuff from it, 
-   (c) Between pass 1 and 2 there's a process called "stocking", in which cell values of tables are parsed. This finally settles the kind of any columns where this has to be inferred from the contents.
-   (d) In pass 2, the property values in columns 2 onwards are assigned to whatever was named in column 1: see below.
