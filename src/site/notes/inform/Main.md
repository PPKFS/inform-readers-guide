Link: https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inform7/1-mn.html
```
# Overview
- Mostly seems to delegate to [[inform/supervisor|supervisor]] and, by extension, [[inform/core|core]]

# Contents
- The setup of the project happens in [4](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inform7/1-mn.html#SP4) via [[inform/supervisor|supervisor]] → `optioneering_complete` in [[inform/Inbuild Control|Inbuild Control]]
	- We then 'go operational', which is setting up the graph in [[inform/Copies|Copies]]
	- Then we build in [[inform/Copies|Copies]]
- Building is in [5](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/inform7/1-mn.html#SP2_5)
	- [[inform/Copies|Copies]] → [[build|build]]
