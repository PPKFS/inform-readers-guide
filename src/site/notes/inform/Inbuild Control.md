# Overview

- [8](https://ganelson.github.io/inform/supervisor-module/1-ic.html#SP8) - The Pretinkering, Tinkering, Nested and Projected phases, aka `optioneering_complete`
	- This is basically the only part of interest
	- Thereâ€™s some stuff about setting up the module, graphing things, etc but those can be a todo later.
	- It makes either a `project_bundle_genre` or a `project_file_genre`
	- This is via the [[inform/Project File Manager|Project File Manager]] and the [[inform/Project Bundle Manager|Project Bundle Manager]]
	- These seem to be the same thing but the bundle manager has multiple things in it
	- These just setup the relevant directories
