# Contents
- We only care about specific conjugations of verbs.
- We assign verbs a priority because often the noun phrases are new as well.
- We can register all forms of the verb (which has a [[inform/Verbs|Verbs]] object): active voice, passive voice, and if it has a present participle then make a “to be X” form (the `copular_verb` is `to be`). We also have [[inform/Verb Meanings|Verb Meanings]] here to add forms.
- There’s some stuff about registering the right tenses.
- Lots of [[inform/Stock Control|Stock Control]].
